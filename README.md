# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Custom chatbot using Chainlit, Llama Index and OpenAI

A custom chatbot built in python using Chainlit, Llama Index and OpenAI

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- Llama Index
- Chainlit
- dotenv

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Set up your OpenAI API key in your environment variables. You can do this by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```
4. Run the script:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

## ‚ùì How it works

The script first loads the OpenAI API key from the environment variables. It then tries to load an existing index from the storage. If it fails (for example, if the index does not exist), it reads documents from a directory, creates a new index from these documents, and persists it to the storage.
